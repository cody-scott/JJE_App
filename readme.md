### Making Oauth requests to yahoo

If you would like to make any requests that hit the yahoo api then you will need to do additional work

Examples of items that hit the api currently are the linking of the user to their teams in yahoo
and updating the current weekly standings.

Since these require requests be sent over HTTPS you will need to setup a reverse proxy using NGINX.

Additionally you will need to configure this proxy to serve a certificate you create to ensure its over https.

#### settings.py file

move these items outside the if block

    SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https')
    SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
    CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True

#### Host file

Update your host file to include a url. ***www.myapp.new*** is what i used below.

#### NGINX Config example

Here is an example configuration. You will need to update paths below with your data.

Specifically update the ssl cert/ssl key paths and the log path

Update anything that says myapp.new to your path

finally update the proxy redirect

        server {
            listen 80;
            return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
        }

        server {
            listen 443;
            server_name www.myapp.new *.myapp.new;

            ssl_certificate "/usr/local/etc/nginx/ssl/myapp.crt";
            ssl_certificate_key "/usr/local/etc/nginx/ssl/myapp.key";

                    proxy_set_header        Host $host;
                    proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                    proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                    proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

                    # Fix the â€œIt appears that your reverse proxy set up is broken" error.
                    proxy_pass          http://localhost:8000;
                    proxy_read_timeout  90;

                    proxy_redirect      http://localhost:8000 https://www.myapp.new;

            }
        }
    }


#### Run the server

    nginx start

then hit your link via the weblink. My example again is ***www.myapp.new***


Everything should redirect through https now.
